Team Einstein is a group of diverse people. We are all eager to learn from different people to become better in our aspired fields. This is our first Team presentation where in
we coded our personal information using different Coding Languges, then pushed into a single repository. Which should be then cloned and create bash file that would print our
outputs in a .csv file format.
